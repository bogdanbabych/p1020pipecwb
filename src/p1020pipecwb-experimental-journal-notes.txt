integrating of a transliteration function
	--> lev distance by default based on a transliteration, or on the feature space ....
	--> both?
		>> compare approaches
		>> initial seed lexicon for sentence alignment ... 
		>> getting via initial alignment / translit non available
		>> suitable for surprise under-resource languages...

using an updated graphonolev module
	further -- test suites, optimisation for speed, regression testing
	
making the case -- English set: distant languages / cognates...


top priority -- integrate a transliteration table... >> 

To develop an argument:
	"interlingua" of feature mapping vs. direct transfer...
	
	- transliteration task;
	

-- further development steps
	>> mappings with multicharacter features for transliteration + 
	dygraphs, etc. >> planning dygraph feature structures and mapping 
	>> experimental set with cognate identification...
