the purpose 
    read files for processing in cwb
    
    working with Ukrainian military texts
    
    tmx files
    and
    alignment -- for tmx
    
    the stages: into tmx; from tmx

the philosophy, scope and the conext of the project.

[philosophy]
    - developing a pipeline for processing corpora  
    - moving to Python and linking relevant libraries, etc.
    
2017/01/04
[stages of the development]
    1. data preparation
    - identifying sources of data: parallel texts
    - re-creating pipeline for tmx 2 cwb
    
    - creating a pipeline 
    
    
[tasks]
    1. a pipeline: tmx --> giza format (1 segment per line)
        - reading xml in a proper way
        - portable for tbx format, etc.
        
        
        
    2. this 
    3. that
    
    
    
[further tasks]
    1. neural MT training from small datasets
        - experiments: linking with data annotation
    
    2. terminological extensions to the interface
        - integrating term annotation ; 
        - moving beyond what has been achieved
        - designing interactive activities for students and participants of the workshops
        - implementing / developing business models...
        
    
    3. deep learning frameworks
    
[development details]
    Reading the whole file to the string / converting
    Processing the string as a separate class
    
    a point on philosophy of the development:
    // handling exceptions, such as no file as errors rather than warnings... --> we need to understand that the programme failed rather than discover this
    from wrong output == it may be too late then to see wrong behavious
    
    // output file name is created from input file name using naming conventions for the project, but not given in a shell script
    // the format of shell scripts needs to be kept simple; the code should be reusable without these scripts.
