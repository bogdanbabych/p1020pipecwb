[stages of the development]
    1. data preparation
    - identifying sources of data: parallel texts
    - re-creating pipeline for tmx 2 cwb
    
    - creating a pipeline 
    
    
[tasks]
    1. a pipeline: tmx --> giza format (1 segment per line)
        - reading xml in a proper way
        - portable for tbx format, etc.
        
        
        
    2. this 
    3. that
    
    
    
[further tasks]
    1. neural MT training from small datasets
        - experiments: linking with data annotation
    
    2. terminological extensions to the interface
        - integrating term annotation ; 
        - moving beyond what has been achieved
        - designing interactive activities for students and participants of the workshops
        - implementing / developing business models...
        
    
    3. deep learning frameworks
