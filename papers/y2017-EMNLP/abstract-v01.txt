The paper presents an automated task-based evaluation framework for an extension to the Levenshtein edit distance metric. This extension explicitly represents linguistic phonological features of compared characters so the metric can use information about charactersâ€™ internal structure rather than treat them as elementary atomic units of comparison. The proposed framework allows us to test alternative configurations of phonological features, and automatically select feature arrangements, which on a range of eval-uation parameters systematically show greater improvements over the traditional character-based Levenshtein edit distance. Resources for computing Levenshtein edit distance with phonological features for a number of alpha-bets are made available as open software.
